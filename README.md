#Handling Missing Values:

    Identify missing values in the dataset.

    Apply an appropriate imputation technique to handle them. Explain your choice.

#Feature Scaling & Encoding:

    Scale the numerical features appropriately. Justify your choice of scaling method (e.g., Min-Max Scaling, Standardization).

#Time-Based Feature Engineering

    Extract relevant time-based features such as:

    Hour of the day

    Day of the week

    Month of the year

    Explain how these features could improve predictive modeling.

#Outlier Detection & Handling

    Identify potential outliers using a suitable statistical method (e.g., IQR, Z-score).

    Propose and apply a method to handle the outliers.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Provide summary statistics for key features.

    Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots, scatter plots) to understand the dataset distribution and relationships between variables.

#Expected Output:

    A well-structured Jupyter Notebook or script implementing the above steps.

    Explanations and visualizations to support your preprocessing choices.
